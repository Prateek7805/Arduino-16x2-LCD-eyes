# Arduino-16x2-LCD-eyes
This code uses spi and 74HC595 to control a 16x2 LCD  
For instructions to set up the LCD using 74HC595 shift register refer [link](https://www.instructables.com/id/Interfacing-LCD-With-Arduino-Using-Only-3-Pins/)   
The code displays eyes on the 16x2 Display  
The pin 10 of the arduino is connected to LATCH pin (pin 12) o 74HC595  
If you don't have the 74hc595 ic then include the standard Liquid crystal library and modify the code, do the wiring according to the standard wiring
